NOTE:
1) Plug and Play : The Metric Interface is such that you can easily experiment with other metrics.

TODO:

1) <b>HIGH PRIORITY</b>: CSVLoader supports only 2d points. Should Support Higher Dimensions. Take number of dimensions as input. No need to calculate at parsing.
2) Further Optimization : We can insert points directly into HNSW rather than loading it into memory.
3) LOW PRIORITY : Perhaps replace Make with CMake.
4) Add Asserts and Error Handling.
5) Make Headers for all the includes
